# WebDevRepository
>Starting my journey through Web Development. This is a project made in my first class in this field and it utilizes a javascript library called Particles.js

This repo includes a project from my first Web Development course in which I learned the very basics of the Web languges and frameworks associated with them. I had an overall theme I wanted to use which was implementing a sort of "RGB Light Strip effect" throughout the many differrent HTML elements displayed on the pages. It was a very first deep dive into the depths of CSS.
